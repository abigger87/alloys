Modularized, Cross-Domain Fungible ERC721 Kinks.

## Overview

Alloys at its core is an ERC721 where traits ("kinks") are fungible. The core [Alloy](./src/Alloy.sol) contract is an ERC721 that renders metadata with kinks tracked by the Registry. The [Registry](./src/Registry.sol) orchestrates [Kink](./src/Kink.sol) contracts (implementations in [src/kinks](./src/kinks/)), which are themselves ERC20 tokens.

Kinks are distributed to Alloy holders through a distribution mechanism.

## Glossary

`Alloys` uses Primitive and Maker's approach of Unconvential Naming inspired by [The Dangers of Surprising Code](https://samczsun.com/the-dangers-of-surprising-code/) h/t [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexangelj) [Mistrusting Variable Names](https://twitter.com/alexangelj/status/1491280313162813441?s=20&t=NoFpNkO9orH8OZ34-DIfMQ).

#### Alloy

[`src/Alloy.sol`](./src/Alloy.sol): Alloy is an ERC721 Token that has one `Clerk` and many `Kinks`.

`cast`: _Mints_ ERC721 tokens.

`keep`: An Alloy _Holder_.

`reap`: _Distributes_ kink tokens to a `keep`.

`meld`: _Registers_ a new Kink for the Alloy.


#### Clerk

[`src/Clerk.sol`](./src/Clerk.sol): Clerk is a registry deployed by the Alloy that manages the Kinks.

`meld`: _Registers_ a new Kink for the Alloy, recording it in the Clerk.

`reap`: _Distributes_ all kink tokens to a `keep`.

`mass`: Returns all melded kinks.


#### Kink

[`src/Kink.sol`](./src/Kink.sol): Kink is an ERC20 that represents a trait of an Alloy.

`seed`: The reaping start time.

`fell`: The reaping end time.

`prex`: The contract deployer.

`kick`: _Initiates_ a kink's token distribution (sets `seed` equal to the current block timestamp).

`roll`: Sets the Alloy address.

`link`: Sets the Clerk address.

## Development

**Setup**
```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

**Building**
```bash
make build
```

**Testing**
```bash
make test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*`.

NOTE: For local deployment, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` before running the `deploy_local.sh` script. Otherwise, hardhat will error due to missing dependencies.

NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs).

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).

### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).
